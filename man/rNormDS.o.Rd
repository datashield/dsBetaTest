\title{rNormDS.o serverside assign function}
\usage{
rNormDS.o(n, mean = 0, sd = 1, force.output.to.k.decimal.places = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{length of the pseudorandom number vector to be generated
as specified by the argument <samp.size> in the function ds.rNorm.o}

\item{mean}{this specifies the mean of the pseudorandom number vector
to be generated as specified by the argument <mean> in the
function ds.rNorm.o. May be a scalar or a vector allowing the mean
to vary from observation to observation.}

\item{sd}{this specifies the standard deviation of the pseudorandom
number vector to be generated as specified by the argument <sd> in the
function ds.rNorm.o May be a scalar or a vector allowing the sd
to vary from observation to observation.}

\item{force.output.to.k.decimal.places}{scalar integer. Forces the output random
number vector to have k decimal places. If 0 rounds it coerces
decimal random number output to integer, a k in range 1-8 forces output to
have k decimal places. If k = 9, no rounding occurs of native output.
Default=9. Value specified by <force.output.to.k.decimal.places> argument
in ds.rNorm.o}
}
\value{
Writes the pseudorandom number vector with the characteristics specified
in the function call as a new serverside vector on the data source on which
it has been called. Also returns key information to the clientside:
the random seed as specified by you in each
source + (if requested) the full 626 length random seed vector this generated in
each source (see info for the argument <return.full.seed.as.set>). It
also returns a vector reporting the length of the pseudorandom vector
created in each source.
}
\description{
primary serverside assign function called by ds.rNorm.o
}
\details{
Generates the vector of pseudorandom numbers from a normal
distribution in each data source as specified by the arguments of
ds.rNorm.o. This serverside function is effectively the same as
the function rnorm() in native R and its arguments are the same.
